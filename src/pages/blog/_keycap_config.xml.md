# Contents

# Introduction

`keycap_config.xml` contains controller glyths generated by launcher application or game itself. These glyths are in DDS format and encoded with base64, then put into an XML file.

# Sega's base64

For simplicity, we will be looking at short string encoded with what I call Sega's base64: `STu[sDA?`.

Every letter encodes 6 bits of original information, and every letter is stored as 8 bits, so it makes sense to look at triplets of encoded letters.

| Letter     | S   | T   | u   |
| ---------- | --- | --- | --- |
| ASCII code | 83  | 84  | 117 |
